#"Microsoft wants to create a new movie studio and create original video content like the big film companies. To this end, they first want to understand how they can successfully enter the movie industry. I decided to change my focus on the profitability of movies in relation to movie studios, release time of the movie and the actual language of the movie.Some of the aspects of a movie I could investigate, will be the questions below:
#What month/ season is the most profit-making to release a movie?
#What are the most well-liked genre on foreign language movies?
#What production budgets and the famous movie studios."
